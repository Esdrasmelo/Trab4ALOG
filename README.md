# Programming Logic activity 

This repository contains the fourth homework of programming logic which was proposed on my System Analysis graduation.

We have to develop the logic or the code using a "pseudo-language" but I wrote the code using "pseudo-language" and I did it using the C programming language too.

I'm learning the C programming language and I decided to write the logic using this language to improve my skills.

This repository contain the two exercices wich were proposed on the fourth homework.
